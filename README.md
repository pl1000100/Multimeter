# Multimetr

This application allows you to display measured values on computer screen.

To properly work, first you need to connect multimeter through COM port to computer (in this case ESCORT-179) and then run the application. 
It will automatically find correct COM port and display measured value on screen, but you need to run multimeter in mode, that will send data through RS232. In ESCORT-179 you can do this by holding range button while turning on multimeter.

Application will convert downloaded data from ASCII format to measured value as shown on screens bellow.
Application window is fully resizable so you can see measurements much easier on your computer instead of multimeter.
